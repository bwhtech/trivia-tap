## What it is

TriviaTap is a live quiz game built on the Frappe Framework. A host puts the game
PIN on the big screen, players join from their phones with the PIN or by
scanning the QR code, and nobody needs an account.

Gameplay is server-authoritative. The correct answer never reaches a player's
device before the question closes, scores are computed from a server-set
deadline, and every submission is validated against the server's own view of
the game.

## Under the hood

- [Frappe Framework](https://github.com/frappe/frappe) for the backend, DocTypes and permissions
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) and [frappe-ui](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui) for the single-page app
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io) to push every state change to hosts and players
- Redis for the hot session state each answer is validated against
- RQ for the single shared ticker that drives every live game loop

## Development setup

1. Set up a bench by following the
   [installation steps](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation)
   and start the server with `bench start`.

2. In another terminal, from your bench directory:

```bash
bench get-app https://github.com/bwhtech/trivia_tap --branch develop
bench --site your-site.localhost install-app trivia_tap
```

The app is served at `/trivia-tap` on your site. For frontend work, run the Vite
dev server against it:

```bash
cd apps/trivia_tap/frontend
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Google login (optional)

Hosts can sign up and log in with Google once the site has a Google key.

1. In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials),
   create an OAuth client ID of type Web application.
2. Add this authorized redirect URI:
   `<site url>/api/method/frappe.integrations.oauth2_logins.login_via_google`
3. In Desk, open Social Login Key, add a new one with provider Google, paste
   the client ID and secret, tick Enable Social Login and set Sign ups to Allow.

Google only accepts plain `http` for `localhost`, not `your-site.localhost`. To
try it locally, run `bench use your-site.localhost`, open
`http://localhost:8000/trivia-tap/login` and register
`http://localhost:8000/api/method/frappe.integrations.oauth2_logins.login_via_google`.

## Testing

```bash
bench --site your-site.localhost set-config allow_tests true
bench --site your-site.localhost run-tests --app trivia_tap
```

## Contributing

This app uses `pre-commit` for code formatting and linting. Please
[install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) and enable it for
this repository:

Pre-commit is configured to use ruff, eslint, prettier and pyupgrade.
