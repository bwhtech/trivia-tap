# Progress

## Phase 18: Host avatar and stats (2026-10-01)

Spec: `specs/phase-18-host-avatar-stats.md`.

### Done

- The profile header avatar opens a picture dialog: a hover tooltip, then
  left and right arrows (and arrow keys) through the initial and the avatar
  pack, saved on Save. It stores the avatar URL in `User.user_image`, so Desk
  shows it too. An uploaded Desk photo stays on offer as "Your photo".
- `HostAvatar` shows the image or the initial in the bar, the menu and the
  profile header. `user_image` comes with the page boot.
- `trivia_tap.api.get_host_stats` counts Ended games, players who were not
  kicked, and quizzes the host owns. The profile header card shows the three.
- Tests in `test_host_stats.py`: zeros for a new host, Cancelled lobbies and
  kicked players left out, another host's games not counted. Full suite: 79
  tests pass.

### Verified

`yarn build` and pre-commit pass. In the browser, desktop and phone, dark and
light: a saved pick shows at once in the bar, survives a reload and shows in
the menu. Stepping and Escape save nothing. An uploaded photo opens as
"Your photo · 1 / 26". Stats read 140, 2,835 and 5
for Administrator.

### Notes

- `IntegrationTestCase` rolls back per class, not per test, so the stats tests
  clear their hosts' rows in `setUp`.

## Phase 17: Host account menu (2026-10-01)

Spec: `specs/phase-17-host-account-menu.md`.

### Done

- Host bar: Play and Library as text tabs with a mint underline, New quiz on
  the right (a plus icon on a phone), and an initial avatar that opens the
  account menu.
- Account menu is a native `popover`: name and email, Profile, a three way
  Auto, Light, Dark theme choice, and Log out. The floating theme button is
  gone from host screens.
- Profile page opens on a header card with the avatar, full name and email.
  Save name stays disabled until the name changes.
- The "Host" eyebrow is gone from the picker, quiz list and profile. New quiz
  moved from the quiz list header to the bar.

### Verified

`yarn build` and pre-commit pass. In the browser, desktop and 390px phone, dark
and light: tabs mark the current page, the bar fits one row on a phone, the
menu opens, closes on Escape and on Profile, switches theme and logs out to
`/join`. Save name is disabled on load, enabled after an edit, disabled again
after save, and the header card shows the new name.

### Notes

- The log in email field is `type="email"`, so the browser refuses
  `Administrator`. Only the dev admin account hits it.

## Phase 16: Brand theme from the logo (2026-10-01)

Spec: `specs/phase-16-brand-theme.md`.

### Done

- Ground moved from purple night to the logo's green-tinted ink, in both themes.
- `accent` is mint (`#20EEA0` dark, `#0A7A52` light, 5.1:1 on the light ground).
- Primary actions (Join game, Log in, Back to join, `.ctl-go`) wear the logo
  gradient through one `--brand` variable, exposed to Tailwind as `bg-brand`.
  Ember keeps answer 1, urgency and danger.
- `sunk`, `card`, QR colours and `theme-color` follow the logo ink and white.
- Join and Log in show the logo beside the wordmark. `LOGO_URL` lives in
  `theme.js` and replaces three copies of the path.
- The lobby QR card gets a `haze` ring: in light mode it melted into the ground.

### Verified

`yarn build` and pre-commit pass. In the browser: join (desktop and phone),
log in, host quiz picker, quiz list, lobby with a player, read-time screen, in
both themes.

### Notes

- The running `bench worker` predates today's frappe pull and fails every
  `tt_ticker` run with `ImportError: defer_enqueue_after_commit`. Games freeze at
  read time until `bench start` restarts. Reveal and podium screens were not
  re-checked for that reason.

## Phase 15: Host profile (2026-09-28)

Spec: `specs/phase-15-host-profile.md`.

### Done

- `/host/profile`, opened from a profile pill in the host bar: edit first and
  last name, change password (current, new, confirm, each with the eye button).
- `trivia_tap.auth.change_password` checks the current password before calling
  frappe's `update_password`. Frappe clears the session cookies on any
  `AuthenticationError`, so calling `update_password` directly logged the host
  out when they mistyped their current password.
- Host bar: logo, Host, Quizzes, then "Hi, <first name>" linking to the
  profile. Log out moved into the profile page, the theme button floats at the
  bottom right of host screens, and host pages keep room under their content
  for it. The bar used to wrap to two rows on a phone; it now stays on one.
- `PasswordInput` no longer carries the login page styling; each page passes
  its own field classes.

### Verified

74 tests pass. In the browser: name saves and survives a reload, a wrong
current password shows "Current password is wrong." and the host stays logged
in, a mismatch is caught before the call, a real change reloads with "Password
changed." and the next save still works, and the new password logs in. Light
and dark, desktop and phone width.

## Phase 14: Log in and sign up inside the SPA (2026-09-28)

Spec: `specs/phase-14-spa-login-signup.md`. A new host goes from `/trivia-tap`
to a live game without leaving the SPA.

### Done

- `/trivia-tap/login` with Log in and Sign up tabs, styled like the join page.
  Guests who open any `/host` route land there with `?redirect=`, and go back to
  that route after. A logged-in user who opens it goes to `/host`.
- `trivia_tap.auth.sign_up` creates the user with the password they typed and the
  `Quiz Host` role, then logs them in. It keeps frappe's guards: sign up
  disabled, the hourly sign up cap, and the same vague message for a taken email.
  Its per-IP limit is frappe's own `max_signups_per_minute`. A first cut used 5
  per hour, which a few weak-password retries used up, and which would lock out
  a school where every teacher shares one IP.
- Password fields have an eye button (`PasswordInput`). Sign up asks for the
  password twice and says "Passwords do not match." before calling the server.
- The join page links hosts to the login page.
- Server messages are HTML (the password policy sends a `<ul>` of hints), which
  showed up as raw tags. `errorText` in `api.js` turns them into text for every
  screen that shows a server error.

### Verified

72 tests pass. In the browser on `trivia-tap.localhost`: wrong password shows
"Invalid login credentials", a weak password shows the policy hint as text, a
new account lands on the host screen, writes a quiz, opens a lobby, a phone
joins by the copied link and the game plays to the podium. Logging back in from
`/host/quizzes` returns there. Light and dark, desktop and phone width.

### Notes

- `trivia-tap.localhost` had sign up disabled in Website Settings. It is now on.
  Sites that keep it off refuse the sign up tab with a clear message.
- `Quiz Host` has desk access, so a new host is a System User. Their role only
  reaches TriviaTap DocTypes.

## Fix: a host sees only their own games (2026-09-28)

Spec: `specs/fix-host-data-scope.md`.

- Any Quiz Host could list every player (nickname, avatar, score, token hash)
  and every answer from every host's games through desk or `frappe.client`.
  Quizzes and sessions were already private.
- `trivia_tap/permissions.py` scopes `TT Participant` and `TT Answer` to the host
  of their session, through `permission_query_conditions` and `has_permission`.
- Verified with two hosts over the live site and in
  `tests/test_permissions.py`, which fails without the hooks. 71 tests pass.

## Phase 13: Rename to TriviaTap (2026-09-27)

Spec: `specs/phase-13-rename-trivia-tap.md`. Quizzly is now TriviaTap, down to
the DocType prefix, the dev site and the repo.

### Done

- Package `quizzly` is now `trivia_tap`, module `Quizzly` is now `TriviaTap`
  (folder `trivia_tap/triviatap`), workspace `TriviaTap`.
- DocTypes `QZ *` are now `TT *`; socket events, rooms, Redis keys, the ticker
  job and browser storage keys moved from `qz` to `tt`. Two patches carry
  existing sites: `rename_qz_doctypes` renames the DocTypes and their tables,
  `rename_qz_quiz_names` turns `QZ-0092` into `TT-0092`.
- SPA moved from `/quizzly/*` to `/trivia-tap/*`. The page file is
  `www/trivia_tap.py`; two route rules map the hyphenated path onto it.
- New logo `public/images/trivia-tap-logo.png` (256px, cropped from the source
  art) in the host bar, the QR badge, the favicon, the apps screen and README.
- Site config key is `trivia_tap_avatar_pack`, theme storage key
  `trivia-tap-theme`.
- Dev site `quizzly.localhost` is now `trivia-tap.localhost`, moved in place
  with quiz data kept. Bench folder is `apps/trivia_tap`.
- README points at `bwhtech/trivia_tap`. Renaming the repo itself needs an
  org admin; this account has write access only.
- Past specs, plan and progress entries use the new names too.
- README screenshots retaken from a real game. The results screen has been two
  screens since phase 12, so the gallery gains `host-stats.png` beside the
  scoreboard.
- The join page inputs showed the forms plugin's blue focus ring over the ember
  border. `focus:ring-0` leaves the ember border alone.
- `test_host_state_reaps_it_and_offers_a_fresh_game` asserted no live session at
  all, so any open lobby on the dev site failed it. It now asserts the abandoned
  game is not offered back.

### Verified

69 tests pass. On `trivia-tap.localhost`: the five old quizzes open under `TT-`
names, a full five-question game plays with eight players (seven over the API,
one in a phone-sized browser), the lobby QR shows the new logo, desk shows the
TriviaTap icon and workspace.

### Notes

- Frappe cannot migrate a site whose app package is gone, so other installed
  sites need the manual steps in the spec before the patches can run.
- A `format:` autoname keeps its counter under an empty series key, so the
  quiz rename needs no series change.
- The workspace JSON `modified` had to move forward, or migrate skips it and the
  sidebar keeps the old link labels.
- `Workspace Sidebar` is inert on this frappe version; nothing recreates it and
  nothing needs to.

## Phase 12: Scoreboard screen (2026-08-22)

Spec: `specs/phase-12-scoreboard-screen.md`. The screen that ends a question is
now two: the answer split, then the standings.

### Done

- `engine.py`: new `scoreboard` phase, always the last beat before the next
  question, whichever side the explanation sits on. `close_question` builds the
  standings (score, points won, new rank, previous rank) and parks them in Redis
  state; `carry_over` hands them through the phases in between untouched. The
  last question skips the screen: the podium is the standings.
- The top five and the streak callouts move off the stats payload onto the
  scoreboard one. The stats screen is the distribution alone now.
- `get_host_state` returns the parked standings for a reload during the phase,
  and drops the `top_5` nothing read any more.
- `Host.vue`: standings screen. Rows open in the old order with the old scores,
  then the points count up on every row while the rows move to their new places.
  `TransitionGroup` keyed by nickname does the move, so row identity survives the
  re-sort. The rank column reads as list position until the rows land, or a
  player who fell out of the top five leaves a gap in the numbering.
- Reload during the phase paints the settled board with no replay.

### Verified

E2E on `trivia-tap.localhost` at 1920x1080, six players answering over the API, a
real worker driving the loop:

- Question closes to the distribution bars alone, `Show scores` moves on.
- Standings open in the previous order at the previous scores, `+974` chips land
  and the rows overtake: ann and eve climb from 4th and 5th past cid, bob, dee.
- Host reload mid-standings comes back to the same five rows, settled.
- Last question's button reads `Final results` and goes straight to the podium.

### Notes

- Engine tests cover the new phase both ways round the explanation and the
  last-question skip: 31 green in `tests/test_engine.py`, plus api/game_ux green.
- A dev-bench aside, not this app: the single bench worker serves `long` after
  `default`, so a five-minute job from another site can starve the ticker and the
  game abandons itself. The host reload settles it, as designed.

## Phase 11: Quiz preview (2026-08-20)

Spec: `specs/phase-11-quiz-preview.md`. Preview in the editor plays the quiz
screens with no session and nobody in the lobby.

### Done

- `AnswerGrid.vue`: the projector answer grid lifted out of `Host.vue` unchanged,
  with `correctOption` as the reveal switch (null while the answer is still out).
  The host screen and the preview now render the same component.
- `QuizPreview.vue`: fullscreen `<dialog>` over the editor that plays itself. Per
  question: read screen (3s), question (its own time limit), answer (5s), and the
  explanation before or after the answer per `explanation_position`, skipped when
  the question has nothing to explain. Engine constants are mirrored client-side.
- The ring drains for real and turns red under five seconds, so a too-short window
  shows up before a room sits through it.
- Pause holds the clock and resumes from where it stopped: the ring is measured
  against the beat's window, not the countdown's, so `useCountdown` is reused
  as-is instead of growing a pause. Back/Next and the arrow keys jump a beat, space
  toggles, the last beat offers Replay, Esc closes and stops the clock.
- The walk clamps itself when an edit shortens the quiz while the dialog is open.
- Preview reads the editor's reactive state, not the saved doc: it covers unsaved
  edits, needs no API and works on a quiz that has never been saved.
- Editor header gets a **Preview** button, disabled until there is a question.

### Deliberately not built

Every screen that only exists because players do: lobby, distribution bars, top 5,
streaks, podium. Previewing those means inventing players and scores, and a made-up
scoreboard teaches an author nothing. Sound too: a preview at a desk is not the room.

### Verified

E2E on `trivia-tap.localhost` as Administrator, build served from the app:

- Preview on a 2-question quiz with explanations after results: 8 beats, played
  through unattended. Read screen counted 3 down, question ran its 10s window with
  the ring going red under five, answer screen held 5s with the correct option
  ticked and the rest dimmed, explanation held its 5s. Pause froze the clock at 4s
  across three seconds of wall time and resumed to 2s without refilling the ring.
  Replay restarted at 1/8, Next disabled on the last beat, Esc closed and stopped
  the clock.
- Regression on the live host screen after the `AnswerGrid` extraction: hosted a
  real session with a player joined, question screen and stats screen (tick, dim,
  distribution bars, top 5) render exactly as before.

## Phase 10: Answer explanation screen (2026-08-19)

Spec: `specs/phase-10-answer-explanation.md`. A screen between the buzzer and
the scoreboard that says why the answer is right.

### Done

- DocTypes: `explanation` (Small Text) and `explanation_image` (Attach Image) on
  `TT Question`, `show_explanation` (Check) on `TT Quiz`.
- Engine (`engine.py`): new `explanation` phase between `question` and `stats`.
  `close_question` still settles scores, streaks, distribution and top 5 at the
  buzzer; whichever screen goes second is parked in Redis state by the one that
  goes first (`closed_payload` or `explanation_after`) and published unchanged,
  so nothing is computed twice.
- `explanation_position` on the quiz puts the screen before the stats (default)
  or after them. The host buttons name the screen they actually open, off
  `before_stats` on the explanation event and `explanation_next` on the stats
  event.
  `hold_seconds` is the shared rule for how long a phase waits: the quiz's
  `explanation_time_limit` (default 10s) with auto-advance on,
  `ADVANCE_WAIT_CAP` with it off.
- The phase is skipped when the toggle is off or the question has neither text
  nor image, so a half-authored quiz never lands on a blank screen.
- Reconnect: `get_host_state` and the player `get_state` return the stored
  explanation payload while the phase is live, so a reload lands back on the
  explanation screen instead of skipping it.
- Host screen: question, the correct answer in its shape colour, image, the
  explanation, a countdown ring (auto-advance only) and a **Show results**
  button. Player screen keeps its own verdict and shows the explanation under
  it, so nobody waits 10 seconds to find out they were right.
- Authoring: one `Explanations on/off` toggle on the quiz, a before/after
  button and a seconds field beside it, plus a text box and an image uploader
  per question that appear with it.

### Tests

- `TestExplanationScreen` in `tests/test_engine.py`: the scoreboard is held back
  behind the explanation, scores are already settled when it shows, it expires
  into stats on its own, and it is skipped both when the quiz toggle is off and
  when the question has nothing to say.
- E2E on `trivia-tap.localhost` with the demo bots: explanation -> results on both
  the host-driven and auto-advance paths, image and text-only questions, host
  reload and player reload mid-explanation, and the editor toggle round-trip.

### Notes

- The bench's single `bench start` worker serves every queue, so a long
  scheduled job from another app on this bench (navgold) blocked the `long`
  queue and left a game with no ticker. Not a TriviaTap bug: the game settled
  itself through `is_abandoned`, which is exactly what that guard is for. A
  dedicated `bench worker --queue long` unblocked testing.

## Live Quiz Rework Phase 4: Trim Submit + Throttle answer_count (2026-07-23)

Spec: `specs/live-quiz-rework/phase-4-submit-and-count.md`. Cut the last two
per-answer costs, and fixed the guest-socket blocker Phase 3 flagged.

### Done

- `submit_answer` (`api.py`): insert now uses `ignore_links=True` (session-active
  and participant-by-token are already validated; the `(participant,
  question_row)` unique index still backstops duplicates). Removed the per-submit
  `answer_count` broadcast block entirely.
- Ticker (`engine.py`): `maybe_push_answer_count` broadcasts the live "N answered"
  count from the ticker instead, but only while a question is open, only on
  change, and at most every `ANSWER_COUNT_THROTTLE` (0.3s). Result: a few
  updates/sec total, flat regardless of player count. Throttle state + immutable
  pins live process-local in `run_ticker` (single deduplicated job), pruned each
  pass to the live session set so finished games don't leak.

### Root-cause fix: guest sockets received no live events (Phase 3 blocker)

- Symptom (Phase 3 note): with the real async ticker, players never advance
  `get_ready` -> `question`; they only limp via `get_state` resync.
- Reproduced with a guest socket.io client against the live socketio server: it
  receives `website`-room events but **nothing** on `tt_session_<pin>`, so no
  game events ever arrive live. Host "worked" only because the frontend resync
  watchdog papers over it for slow lobby changes, not fast question transitions.
- Root cause: `apps/trivia_tap/package.json` has `"type": "module"`, so Node loads
  `realtime/handlers.js` as ESM. The frappe socketio server `require()`s it as
  CommonJS and gets `{}` instead of the handler function; `app_handler(socket)`
  throws and is swallowed, so `tt_join`/`tt_leave` never register and no socket
  ever joins the session room.
- Fix: `apps/trivia_tap/realtime/package.json` = `{"type":"commonjs"}` overrides the
  module type for just that directory, so the CJS handler loads again without
  disturbing the ESM app root the frontend build relies on. Verified at the
  `require()` level (now returns `function trivia_tap_handlers`). **Needs a socketio
  restart to take effect** (the running server cached the failed load).

### Tests

- `run-tests --app trivia_tap`: 59 green. The engine test that filtered out
  `answer_count` events is unaffected (no such events emitted now).
- Lint: pre-commit clean on all changed files.

### Pending

- Browser E2E (3+ guests: counter climbs via ticker, players advance to
  questions and answer) is blocked on a `bench` restart to reload the socketio
  handler. Run after restart per the rework rule (no merge until browser green).

## Live Quiz Rework Phase 3: Batch Scoring Writes (2026-07-23)

Spec: `specs/live-quiz-rework/phase-3-batch-scoring.md`. Killed the N+1 write
loops so reveal time stops scaling with player count.

### Done

- `close_question`: the participant loop now builds two in-memory dicts and no
  longer does I/O per participant. `answer_updates` (`{answer: {is_correct,
  points}}`) and `participant_updates` (`{participant: {score, streak}}`,
  streak-reset-to-0 for non-answerers in the same dict) flush through two
  `frappe.db.bulk_update` calls after the loop. Same commit + `question_closed`
  push as before.
- `finish_session`: ranks persist via one `frappe.db.bulk_update("TT
  Participant", {name: {"rank": rank}})` instead of one `set_value` per player.
- `bulk_update` builds chunked CASE-WHEN UPDATEs and does **not** commit
  internally, so the ticker's `tt_tick` savepoint isolation (Phase 2) is intact.
  It also no-ops on an empty dict, so a question nobody answered is safe.

### Tests

- `run-tests --app trivia_tap`: 22 engine + 15 game-ux tests green. Scores, streaks,
  ranks, and podium identical to before — batching changed no number.
- Load check (`scripts`-style console driver, 200 participants, half correct):
  `close_question` went **207.9 ms -> 36.7 ms**. The residual is the answer
  fetch, not the writes; write time no longer scales with player count.

### Browser E2E (trivia-tap.localhost)

- Host + 3 guests (Alice/Bob/Cara) played "General Knowledge" driven by the real
  async `long` RQ worker (not the synchronous driver Phases 1-2 fell back to).
  The shared ticker marched through all 5 questions and rendered a correct podium
  with ranks 1/2/3 on both host and player screens. `finish_session`'s batched
  rank write and `close_question`'s batched score writes ran with **zero** Error
  Log entries.
- Pre-existing, out-of-scope: with the real async ticker, the **player** view
  never advances from `get_ready` to the `question` phase (options never render),
  so guests can't answer and everyone scores 0. Host advances fine and gets every
  event. This is a player realtime/state issue untouched by this diff (which only
  edits `close_question`/`finish_session` DB writes) and predates it. Flagged for
  a separate fix; does not affect scoring correctness, which the unit suite gates.

## Live Quiz Rework Phase 2: Multi-Game Scale (2026-07-21)

Spec: `specs/live-quiz-rework/phase-2-multi-game-scale.md`. Proved the shared
ticker drives many concurrent games on the same workers with no starvation, the
payoff of Phase 1's redesign.

### Done

- `run_ticker` gained per-session isolation: each session's step runs under a
  `tt_tick` savepoint inside its own try/except, commits on success, and on error
  rolls back to the savepoint + `log_error`s and continues. One bad game can no
  longer stall or kill the ticker for the others.
- Fixed a real ticker bug the self-heal path was hiding: `get_state` read through
  Frappe's process-local cache (`use_local_cache` default True), so in the
  long-lived ticker a session whose state had expired in Redis still returned its
  last-seen dict forever. The `if not state: srem` self-heal never fired and the
  ticker spun on the vanished session. `get_state` now reads with
  `use_local_cache=False`, like `pop_control` already does.
- Lifecycle was already airtight from Phase 1 and confirmed so: `active_sessions`
  is `srem`'d on finish, on `end`, and on abandon (all route through
  `finish_session`); the ticker `srem`s any session whose state has vanished; and
  `enqueue_game_loop` always re-enqueues the deduped `tt_ticker`, so starting any
  new game self-heals a dead ticker and picks up every registered session.
  `is_abandoned` still settles a session the ticker somehow dropped.

### Tests

- `test_ticker_survives_bad_session`: seeds a bogus session that raises every pass
  alongside a real game; the real game still reaches the podium. Note: the guard
  must roll back to the **savepoint**, not call bare `frappe.db.rollback()`, which
  would discard the whole test transaction (and, in prod, sibling sessions' writes
  from the same pass).

### Browser E2E (trivia-tap.localhost)

- 5 concurrent games: 5 isolated browser guests joined 5 lobbies, all started, all
  rendered the same live question simultaneously (Q1 of 5), auto-advanced through
  all five questions, and every player reached the podium ("You won").
- Backend proof via `scripts/concurrent_games.py` (console driver, phases driven by
  the real `long` RQ worker): 5 games marched in lockstep get_ready -> question ->
  closed for q0..q4, with **exactly one** `tt_ticker` job the entire run
  (`max concurrent tt_ticker jobs observed: 1`).

## Live Quiz Rework Phase 1: Ticker Tracer (2026-07-21)

Spec: `specs/live-quiz-rework/phase-1-ticker-tracer.md`. Replaced the per-game
busy-wait loop (`run_game_loop`, one RQ job per session) with a shared ticker
plus a per-session Redis state machine.

### Done

- `run_ticker`: one self-looping RQ job (`job_id="tt_ticker"`, `deduplicate=True`,
  queue `long`). Each pass reads `tt:active_sessions`, per session pops control and
  advances when a control fired or `now >= next_ts`, commits, sleeps `TICK_SECONDS`
  (0.5). Exits when the active set is empty.
- `advance_session(session_doc, state, control)` dispatches on `state["phase"]`
  (`get_ready` -> `question` -> `stats` -> next / finish). `end` control finishes
  any phase.
- `get_ready` / `open_question` / `close_question` lost their internal while/sleep
  loops; they now just write state (extended with `phase` and `next_ts`) and push.
  `close_question` reads `auto_advance` fresh to size the stats wait.
- `enqueue_game_loop` seeds the first `get_ready` state, `sadd`s the session, then
  enqueues the shared ticker. `finish_session` `srem`s on the way out.
- Deleted `run_game_loop`, `wait_question_window`, `wait_before_next`, `POLL_SECONDS`.
- Tests green (`test_engine`, `test_game_ux`): `TestGameLoop` now drives the game via
  `enqueue_game_loop` + `run_ticker`; added coverage for auto-advance-off hold and
  advance-on-last-question finish.

### Browser E2E (trivia-tap.localhost)

- Full game played host + guest: get_ready pause -> question + countdown -> reveal
  -> auto-advance -> podium. Host **skip** closed the question within ~0.5s; the
  ticker exited with no lingering job after finish.
- Env note: this bench's `long` RQ queue had no worker and was clogged with hanging
  jobs from another site, so the browser run drove `run_ticker` synchronously via
  `bench execute` (same realtime path). The RQ enqueue/dedup itself is unchanged
  standard `frappe.enqueue`.

### Branches

- Work committed on `feat/live-quiz-ticker` (spec commit + implementation commit).
- Branched `experimental` off it and merged `feat/live-quiz-ticker` in (fast-forward,
  same commits). Both branches local only, not pushed.

## Phase 9: README with screenshots (2026-07-20)

Spec: `specs/phase-9-documentation.md`. The README was still the app-scaffold
default. It is now the front door: hero image, what-it-is, a collapsed gallery
of eight screenshots, features, stack, dev setup, testing, contributing.

### Done

- Eight screenshots in `docs/images/`, all from one real session against
  `trivia-tap.localhost` (520 KB total). Host shots at 1440x900, player shots at
  390x844 with DPR 2, one player shot in dark theme. Podium needed 1440x1010
  to fit its leaderboard and button in a single frame.
- `scripts/seed_demo.py`: creates the "General Knowledge" demo quiz. Run with
  `bench --site trivia-tap.localhost console < scripts/seed_demo.py`.
- `scripts/demo_bots.py`: joins seven named players over the guest HTTP API and
  answers questions for them at plausible accuracies, so the lobby,
  distribution and podium look like a real game. Both scripts are throwaway
  tooling for pictures, not fixtures.
- No CI badges: this repo has no git remote yet, so the badge URLs would not
  resolve. Add them with the remote.

### Verified

`bench --site trivia-tap.localhost run-tests --app trivia_tap`: 56 tests, all green.
`pre-commit run --all-files`: clean. Every command in the README was run as
written.

### Notes

- The bench runs a single `bench worker` serving short, default and long. The
  game loop is enqueued on `long`, and while that worker was busy with another
  site's scheduled jobs the loop never started, so `is_abandoned` fired at 30s
  and every session jumped straight to an all-zero podium. Captures needed a
  dedicated `frappe worker --queue long` alongside it. Not an app bug, but a
  real deployment constraint: a live game needs a worker that is not competing
  with scheduled jobs.
- The podium screen scrolls inside its own container, not the window, so with
  eight players a 900px-tall viewport clips the tail of the leaderboard and the
  "New game" button. Reachable, but only if you know to scroll there.

## CI workflow fixes (2026-07-20)

Spec: `specs/phase-8-ci.md`, written after comparing our workflows against `frappe/wiki`. We already had wiki's server-test and linter jobs, on newer action and MariaDB versions than theirs. The one real gap is Playwright E2E, which wiki has and we don't, and which matters more here than there: trivia_tap is two browsers and a socket server, and the seam between them is exactly what `bench run-tests` cannot see.

The E2E harness is not built. It is half a day of work (root `package.json`, config, auth setup, two-context helpers, socketio under CI, countdown-timer flake), and `/agent-browser` already covers every fix manually, so the gap is "no unattended gate", not "untested app". Deferred until someone else contributes or a realtime regression ships unnoticed.

Three config fixes shipped now, no new dependency:

- `ci.yml` concurrency group was `develop-trivia-tap-${{ github.event.number }}`. That expands to empty on `push`, so every push to develop shared one group key and cancelled the run before it. Now `${{ github.event.number || github.ref }}`.
- `ci.yml` gained `paths-ignore` for `**.js`, `**.vue`, `**.css`, `**.ts`. Frontend-only changes no longer build a bench to run python tests that cannot have changed.
- Dropped the `cypress/.*` exclude from the eslint pre-commit hook. Inherited from boilerplate; no such directory ever existed here.

### Verified

Both files parse as YAML. `paths-ignore` and the concurrency key only demonstrate themselves on a real PR, so neither is verified beyond that.

## Theme toggle on the player side (2026-07-20)

The light theme shipped with a control on the host bar and in the lobby row, so only a logged-in host could switch. Players got whatever `prefers-color-scheme` said and no way out of it, which is backwards: the host is on one laptop they control, the players are on twenty phones in a room whose brightness nobody polled.

- `ThemeButton.vue` wraps the existing `cycleTheme` from `theme.js`. Icon-only (🌗 auto, ☀️ light, 🌙 dark) with the label in `aria-label` and `title`, matching the mute button next to it rather than the host bar's text pill, because the player header is a phone header with no room for words.
- Placed in the `Play.vue` header beside mute, and absolutely positioned top-right on `Join.vue`, which has no chrome of its own. `HostBar.vue` and `Host.vue` then dropped their "Theme: auto" text buttons for the same component, so one glyph means one thing everywhere in the app.
- The component carries no styling of its own, only the glyph, the cycling and the label. The host wears it as a `ctl` pill, the players as a bare header icon, and `.ctl` is plain CSS that sits after Tailwind's utilities in `index.css`, so a component with default padding could not be overridden into a pill anyway. The player pages repeat the four utility classes rather than the component growing a variant prop.
- No state added. `theme.js` already persists to `localStorage` and applies on load, so a player's choice survives join, the whole game, and a reload.

### Verified

Real join at 390x844: toggled on the join screen (auto → light), joined a live session with a PIN from `create_session`, and the choice carried into the play header, where cycling to dark repainted the lobby. Host side at 1280x800: the pill in the quizzes bar and the one in the lobby control row both cycle and repaint. Test sessions deleted afterwards.

## Phase 7: avatar carousel (2026-07-20)

Spec: `specs/phase-7-avatar-carousel.md`. Shipped as specced, `Join.vue` only, no backend.

- Every slot keeps the large size and only the face inside scales (`scale-[0.62]` unselected, `scale-100` selected). Sizing the button itself would reflow the row on every tap and jump the strip under the thumb; a transform does not reflow, so the row height and the join button below it stay put.
- The ring, background, scale and opacity all moved onto a `<span>` inside the button. The button is now just the fixed slot, so the gold ring hugs the big face instead of a full-size slot around a shrunken one.
- Centring became a `watch` on the selection with `flush: "post"` (plus the existing `onMounted` call, since an `immediate` watcher fires before the DOM exists). `motion-safe:scroll-smooth` animates it, and is `motion-safe` because CSS `scroll-behavior` is not covered by the global reduced-motion transition-duration override.
- Strip moved out of the desktop right column (`md:col-span-2`) and dropped its `md:max-w-sm` cap, so desktop reads PIN, nickname, faces, join, the same order a phone already had.
- Then the desktop layout went away entirely: `Join.vue` has no `md:` classes left. The two-column grid was only ever there to balance the tall 6-column avatar block, and once the faces were a strip the wide form was two stretched inputs next to each other and nothing else. One centred `max-w-sm` column at every width, so what a host sees on a laptop is what the players see on their phones. Same reason the strip keeps its gutter bleed on desktop now: the cut-off faces at the edge are what say it scrolls, at any width.

- Strip trim: `.no-scrollbar` (new utility in `index.css`, `scrollbar-width: none` plus the `-webkit-scrollbar` rule) hides the desktop bar under the row, which was redundant next to the cut-off faces at the gutter. `pb-1` became `py-1.5`, because `overflow-x: auto` also clips vertically and the selected face's ring was losing its top edge. Gap tightened to `gap-1`, since a shrunken 27px face inside a 44px slot already carries most of the spacing.

### Verified

Headless browser at 390x844 and 1280 wide. Phone: opening random pick lands centred and big, tapping the last face in the roster scrolls the strip to its end (`scrollLeft` 890 of max 890) with the join button unmoved. Desktop: strip is the full-width row between the inputs and the join button. `pre-commit` clean on the changed file.

## Phase 5 leftovers: light theme and avatar strip (2026-07-20)

Spec: `specs/phase-5-visual-identity.md`, both sections rewritten from "Deferred" to what shipped. Phase 5 now has nothing outstanding.

### Light theme

- The spec's plan was to make all eight tokens flip. That was the wrong split, and building it showed why: the four answer inks are the brand. A player learns "red is top-left" once, and a tile that changes hue with the room breaks the one thing the colour scheme exists to do. They do not theme at all.
- What themes is the ground and what sits on it: `night` / `dusk` / `haze` / `paper`, plus `alert` / `accent` / `ok`. The second trio is the ember, gold and lagoon hues *as text on the ground*, which has to carry 4.5:1 and so darkens where the fill below it cannot. One token could not be both a vivid tile and legible small text on white; splitting the roles is what the original plan missed.
- Fixed, never themed: `ember`, `lagoon`, `gold`, `orchid` (the tiles), `sunk` (the ink they carry), `card` (the QR quiet zone, which needs a light ground in either theme).
- Tokens are RGB channel triplets, not hex, so Tailwind's opacity modifiers keep working: `text-paper/40` is used 13 times.
- `prefers-color-scheme` picks the default. A Theme control on the host bar and in the lobby control row overrides it in both directions and persists in `localStorage`. The OS preference alone was not enough: the case this exists for is a bright room, and the laptop driving the projector is usually still set to dark. It is in the lobby row as well as the bar because the bar is hidden once a game starts, which is exactly when a host notices the screen washing out.
- Deleted `SHAPES[].hex` in passing: dead since phase 5, nothing read it.

### Avatar scroll strip

- One horizontal `overflow-x: auto` row with `snap-x`, capped `max-w-sm` on desktop. It bleeds past the page gutter on a phone, because the faces cut off at both edges are the only thing that says it scrolls.
- The opening pick is random and lands anywhere in the roster, so the selected button scrolls itself into view on mount. Without that the strip opens on the first face and nothing looks chosen.

### Verified

Full game in a real browser, host at 1440x900 and two guests: picker, lobby, read time, question (with and without an image), reveal, leaderboard, podium, plus both player views, in light and again in dark to check for regressions. Join screen at a real 390x844 viewport in both themes: the strip is one row and the join button clears the fold. Toggle checked to persist across a reload. 56 tests green, `pre-commit run --all-files` clean.

### Known gap

`--color-scheme` emulation reverted to dark partway through a browser session more than once, so the OS-preference path was confirmed on the join page and the toggle carried the rest of the run. The two paths set the same tokens.

## Fix: host screen on a phone (2026-07-20)

No spec. `Host.vue` only, no API and no doctype change. Every host screen was sized for a projector and broke at 390px.

### Done

- Lobby: PIN `text-6xl` up to `sm:text-8xl`, QR `size-40` up to `sm:size-48`, padding and gaps scaled, and the PIN block centres under the QR on a phone. The copy button moved inside the join-host `<p>` as an inline element, so it follows the last line when the URL wraps instead of floating beside the first.
- Question: the question text takes its own full-width row below the timer ring and the answer counter (`flex-wrap` plus `order-last w-full sm:order-none`). Beside a 96px ring and a counter it had a column too narrow to read two words in. The question image caps at 22vh under `sm`, which keeps all four options on screen without scrolling.
- Results and podium: display sizes scaled, podium columns `w-24` up to `sm:w-36`, and leaderboard rows got `gap-3` with `truncate` on the nickname and `shrink-0` on the score, which used to collide.

### Verified

Live on `trivia-tap.localhost` at 390x844: lobby with and without a player, get-ready, question, closed stats, podium. Desktop at 1440x900 renders identically to before on the lobby and question screens.

### Notes

- The bench `long` queue is backed up with jobs from other sites behind a single worker, so `run_game_loop` never gets picked up: a started game sits on "Starting…" until `is_abandoned` settles it and the host lands on the podium. Testing ran the loop directly with `bench execute trivia_tap.engine.run_game_loop`. Bench config, not app code.

## Phase 6: Navigation (2026-07-19)

Spec: `specs/phase-6-navigation.md`. Frontend only, no API and no doctype change.

### Done

- `components/HostBar.vue` on `/host`, `/host/quizzes`, `/host/quizzes/:name`: wordmark, Host/Quizzes links with the existing `data-on` active treatment, the logged-in user, and logout through the framework's own `logout` method. Rendered by the three screens rather than by a layout route, because `App.vue` is a bare `<router-view />` and turning it into a layout host would cost more than the three lines of markup it saves.
- The bar is hidden the moment `/host` holds a live session. A lobby, question, or podium is what 40 people in a room look at, and nav on it competes with the PIN.
- The per-screen back links it replaces are gone (`← Back to hosting`, `← All quizzes`), as is the picker's `Edit quizzes` link; the picker keeps a `New quiz` CTA only while the host has no quizzes.
- `readError(e)` in `api.js` now backs every host screen's catch. A non-host used to get whatever the framework said, which names doctypes and permissions; the editor did not translate it at all.
- `End game` names the cost: "End the game for all N players". A mid-game leave keeps the participant row on purpose (scores), so the count stays truthful after someone walks out.
- Player `Leave` moved from the lobby and podium screens into the persistent header, so it exists during a question too. Hidden on the podium, where `Back to join` is already the primary action, and on `kicked`, where the header does not render.

### Verified

End to end on `trivia-tap.localhost`: host nav across all three screens with the active pill correct, bar gone the instant a game started and back after `New game`, a player leaving mid-question and landing on `/join`, logout landing on `/join`, and a logged-out `/host` bouncing to login with the redirect intact. 56 tests green, `pre-commit run --all-files` clean.

### Deferred

- **Session history nav.** `/host/history` is specced in phase 4b and unbuilt. It becomes one more link in the bar and nothing else, which is the point of having the bar in one component now.
- **Mobile host bar.** Plain text links fit at 390px. Collapse it when a fourth or fifth link makes it wrap.

## Phase 4a: Content authoring (2026-07-19)

Spec: `specs/phase-4a-content-authoring.md`. The last slice of phase 4, shipped after 4b/4c and phase 5. Removes the Desk-only authoring constraint: a host now writes and plays a quiz without leaving the SPA.

### Done

- `TT Question.image` (Attach Image). `question_payload` carries `image_url`, null when absent, so an image-free quiz publishes exactly what it published before. Rendered contained above the answer grid on both screens: 40vh on the projector, 26vh on the phone, so options never leave the fold.
- Authoring runs on `frappe.client.*` (`get`, `insert`, `save`, `delete`), plus one endpoint, `list_quizzes`, for the per-quiz question count. Four hand-written CRUD APIs were built first and then deleted: they re-implemented the framework, and their by-hand ownership check duplicated `if_owner` on `TT Quiz`. They were not a smaller attack surface either, since `frappe.client.save` is whitelisted for every logged-in user regardless.
- Two rules the standard path imposes on the client, both found by testing and now pinned: send the loaded doc back as it came (frappe refuses a save that drops `creation` or `owner`, and rejects a stale `modified`, which is concurrent-edit protection the hand-written `save_quiz` silently lacked), and rebuild the question rows without `name` or `idx` (frappe keeps an `idx` it is given, so rows carrying the old one ignore a reorder).
- Validation split by kind. The `TT Quiz` controller owns integrity (at least one question, non-blank text and options, `correct_option` in 1..4) so nothing on any path can write a quiz the engine cannot play. The editor owns the 5..120 second range with native `min`/`max` and a clamp, because it is an authoring taste: engine tests use 1 to 2 second questions on purpose, and putting the range in the controller broke 26 of them for no gain.
- `/host/quizzes` (list, create, delete) and `/host/quizzes/:name` (editor). Options are edited inside the four game-coloured pills with the correct-option radio in place, so the author sees the player's screen while writing. Image upload is frappe-ui's `FileUploader` against the framework's `upload_file`, no custom endpoint.
- The `/host` quiz picker now reads `list_quizzes` instead of `frappe.client.get_list` and links to the editor.
- Tests: 5 in `tests/test_authoring.py`, covering only what this app adds to the standard path (reorder through `frappe.client.save` landing in `idx` order, the controller's rejections, the question count, `LinkExistsError` on a played quiz, `image_url` present and null). 56 green across the app.

### Exit criteria verified

Quiz written entirely in the SPA (two questions, a checkerboard PNG uploaded onto the first), then hosted and played to podium with a real guest in a second browser: image on both host and player question screens, answers scored (1379), podium reached. Desk never opened. The image-free question rendered identically to before. `pre-commit run --all-files` clean.

### Fixed while testing

- The editor showed `0` in an unset time-limit field, because an unset Frappe Int reads back as 0. It now loads as empty and shows the quiz default as the placeholder.
- Native radios inside the coloured answer pills rendered as a white disc with a blue dot: frappe-ui's stylesheet fills inputs, and `accent-color` alone could not fix the ground. They are `appearance-none` circles drawn from the border now.
- A refused delete printed the framework's link error verbatim, HTML and all, so the host read raw `<a href>` markup pointing into Desk. The list now catches `LinkExistsError` by `exc_type` and says the quiz has been played.

### Deferred

- **Drag-reorder.** Up/down buttons instead, no dependency. Build drag when a host writes ~30-question quizzes and moving a row means crossing a screenful.
- **Uploaded images are not attached to the parent quiz**, because a new quiz has no name yet when the picture is picked. They are ordinary public `File` rows, so a removed image leaves a file behind. Attach them (and clean up) when the file list gets noisy.

## Phase 5: Visual identity (2026-07-19)

Spec: `specs/phase-5-visual-identity.md`. Engine untouched; CSS, markup, and one new component.

### Done

- Night-sky direction replaces the Kahoot lookalike. Eight tokens in `tailwind.config.js` (`night`, `dusk`, `haze`, `paper`, `ember`, `lagoon`, `gold`, `orchid`); the four answer inks differ in hue and lightness so they survive a washed-out projector and colourblind players.
- Answer marks are now bolt, spark, moon, hex. `svgFill` stays a spelled-out literal per shape, same reason as before: Tailwind only generates class names it can see.
- Type: Bricolage Grotesque display, Instrument Sans body, Martian Mono for PIN, timers, scores, ranks. Loaded in `frontend/index.html` with system fallbacks.
- Signature: `components/DrainRing.vue`, one conic-gradient arc behind a radial mask. Time drains out of a ring instead of sliding along a bar, at three sizes across the phone and the projector, pulsing under 5 seconds.
- Player question screen is full-bleed 2x2 tiles below a slim question strip, so a thumb reaches any corner.
- Host read time got its own centred screen with a gold countdown; it was a bare left-aligned line with no timer, because the host never started a countdown on `get_ready`. Now it does, on both the live event and `applyState`.
- Answer distribution bars sit in `dusk` tracks aligned to the answer grid. Before, a 0-vote bar was a hairline floating in a void.
- Host controls use `.ctl` / `.ctl-go` in `index.css` rather than frappe-ui `Button`, which only ships a light theme.
- Quality floor: one gold `:focus-visible` outline for every control, `prefers-reduced-motion` collapsing the ring pulse, podium rise, and bar growth, responsive to 390px.
- Fixed a pre-existing ruff UP033 in passing: `avatars.load_pack` now uses `functools.cache`.

### Verified

Full 4-question game in a real browser, host at 1440x900 plus two guest phones at 390x844: quiz picker, lobby with QR and player chips, read time, question, locked-in, reveal with distribution and leaderboard, podium, both host and player views. `pre-commit run --all-files` clean.

### Deferred

Both are written up in the spec with the trigger condition, not just the idea.

- **Light theme.** App is dark-only. Build it when someone hosts in a bright room and reports it washing out; the answer inks would need their own light-ground values, not an inversion.
- **Avatar picker as a scroll strip.** The 6-column grid fits at 24 avatars. Build it when a pack ships more than ~30 and the join button drops below the fold.

## Fixes found in end-to-end testing (2026-07-19)

A full host + two-player run in a real browser turned up three defects, all now fixed.

- **Host stuck on a dead game.** A session whose loop worker died stayed `Active` forever, and `get_live_host_session` kept handing it back, so the quiz picker never returned and "New game" was a no-op. `end_session` was no better: it only set a Redis control flag that no loop was left to read. `engine.is_abandoned` now names the condition (Active, no loop state, older than the state TTL), `get_live_host_session` reaps every abandoned session it walks past, `get_host_state` settles a remembered one into its podium, and `end_active_session` ends a loopless game directly instead of flagging it. Five tests in `test_game_ux.py`, including one that a Lobby waiting for players is never reaped.
- **Countdown bar was invisible.** Both the host and player timer bars used `bg-ink-gray-9`, which frappe-ui defines as an ink (text) token only, so the fill computed to `rgba(0,0,0,0)` and the bar always read as empty. Now `bg-surface-gray-7`.
- **Locked-in shape rendered black.** The confirmation shape built its SVG class at runtime with `fill.replace("bg-", "fill-")`, so Tailwind never saw those class names and only generated the ones that happened to appear elsewhere: red worked, blue, amber and green came out black. `SHAPES` now carries an `svgFill` literal per shape.
- **A quiet socket froze a screen for good.** Two player tabs stopped receiving events mid-game and never recovered: the design has no polling fallback, and `useSessionRoom` only re-joined the room on a `connect` event that never came. It now tracks the time of the last event and re-joins (plus resyncs) after 20 seconds of silence, so a lost room membership or a reconnect that never lands costs one `get_state` instead of the rest of the game. Long pauses between questions are normal, hence the generous threshold; verified in the browser that a silent stats pause triggers exactly one resync per interval and an active game triggers none.
- **Result badge was unreadable.** The correct/wrong circle used `bg-surface-green-3` and `bg-surface-red-3`, two tokens with opposite lightness, so no single glyph colour worked: a black ✓ on dark green, then a white ✕ on pale red. Both now use the strong game palette (`bg-green-600` / `bg-red-500`) with white glyphs.
- **Tests leaked their fixtures onto the site.** Engine steps commit mid-test, so the framework rollback left every test quiz and session behind; the host's quiz picker had grown to 26 stray "Engine Quiz" entries and 6 sessions stuck `Active`. `GameTestCase.tearDown` now deletes what it created, and the existing junk was purged.

### Verified

Full 4-question game, host plus two guests, played through get-ready, live answer counts, reveal with distribution, streak callout and podium. Scores matched the engine (Ada 2043, Grace 2041).

## Phase 4c: Player fun (2026-07-19)

Phase 4 was split into four independently shippable slices (`specs/phase-4a..4d`); this is the third.

### Done

- Avatar packs. A pack is a JSON manifest in `trivia_tap/avatar_packs/` holding the roster, the background palette, and the framing; `site_config.trivia_tap_avatar_pack` picks the active one. `trivia_tap/avatars.py` loads it and hands it to the SPA through the existing portal boot context, so the roster has one source of truth and the join path costs no extra request. Shipped pack is DiceBear `notionists` (CC0, 24 avatars).
- `yarn build:avatars` pre-renders `kind: "dicebear"` packs to static SVG under `trivia_tap/public/avatars/<pack>/`, output committed. The DiceBear libraries are devDependencies only and never reach the runtime bundle; at runtime an avatar id is just an `<img>` URL, which is also how a bought `kind: "static"` pack drops in with no code change.
- `TT Participant.avatar`, validated in the controller against the active roster. `join_session` takes an optional `avatar` and falls back to a crc32-of-nickname pick. `avatar` now rides along on lobby updates, leaderboards, top-5, streak callouts, podium, and `get_state`.
- Nickname generator: three suggestions with a reroll on the join screen. Word lists live in `trivia_tap/nicknames.py` and reach the SPA through the boot context.
- Sound synthesised with Web Audio (`frontend/src/sound.js`): countdown tick, submit blip, correct/wrong stings, podium arpeggio, plus a persisted mute toggle on both screens.
- Tests: 9 new (`test_avatars.py`, `test_nicknames.py`). 45 green across the app.

### Exit criteria verified

Full 4-question game in headless Chrome (host + two players) against the live site: both players picked distinct avatars and generated nicknames, and those avatars showed on the host lobby chips, the live leaderboard, the player header, and both podiums. No console errors from the audio path. Contact sheet of all 24 avatars reviewed at render size.

### Notes

- No free avatar library matches the 3D-rendered reference look (Inner Teens); that style is a commercial category. The pack system exists so that decision stays reversible: swapping to a bought 3D pack is a manifest plus a folder.
- `notionists` draws half-body portraits that read as a cropped torso in a circle. Framing (`scale: 140`, `translateY: 25`) is per-pack manifest data, chosen by rendering a comparison sheet.
- An unknown avatar id is rejected rather than defaulted, so a stale client or a manifest entry that was never rendered fails loudly instead of showing a blank circle. A test asserts every manifest id has a file on disk.
- `trivia_tap/avatars.py` (module) and `trivia_tap/avatar_packs/` (data) are deliberately not the same name; a module and a package directory sharing a name in one directory breaks imports.
- Players default to muted and the host defaults to audible: a classroom of phones all unmuting at once is a bad time.
- Lobby background music is dropped from scope. A listenable loop is a composition, not a synth line.
- Cleared three stale `Active` sessions from earlier phase testing; `get_live_host_session` picks the newest live session, so an abandoned one hides the quiz picker forever. Worth a real fix (auto-expire) if it recurs outside tests.

## Phase 3: Game UX (2026-07-19)

### Done

- Player screen (`Play.vue`) is one state machine: lobby -> get-ready -> question -> locked-in -> result -> podium, plus a kicked terminal state. Kahoot shapes (triangle/diamond/circle/square, colour keyed to the canonical option id), local countdown bar, per-player answer shuffle seeded by the participant token, result interstitial with correct/wrong, points, streak, rank and top-5.
- Host screen (`Host.vue`): lobby with giant PIN, client-side QR (`qrcode`), join URL, name grid, lock/kick/auto-advance/start; game view with live answer count, timer bar, correct-answer reveal, distribution bar chart, top-5 and streak callouts, next/skip/end; podium with a 1-2-3 stand and the full leaderboard.
- Engine: a 3-second `get_ready` read-the-question pause before each question (own Redis phase, so reconnect lands in it too). `question` payloads now carry `window_ms` (clients count down from receipt, so client clock skew cannot matter) and `randomize_answer_order`.
- New APIs: `get_host_state` (whole host screen in one call; finds the host's live session when no name is passed, so a reload restores mid-game), `get_result` (own outcome for the interstitial, keeping per-player data out of the broadcast), `set_auto_advance` (loop re-reads the flag each pause, so it can flip mid-game). `get_state` gained rank/leaderboard and now resolves Ended sessions so a player who reloads on the podium keeps it.
- Nickname profanity filter in `trivia_tap/profanity.py`, applied in `join_session`: leetspeak folded, matched as a substring against a curated wordlist.
- Tests: 9 new in `tests/test_game_ux.py` (filter both ways, host state in lobby/mid-question/non-host, own result and rank, podium after reload). 36 green across the app.

### Exit criteria verified

Full 4-question game driven in headless Chrome with three browser sessions (host + two players) against the live site and a real RQ worker: get-ready countdown, shapes, per-player shuffle confirmed different for each player, correct/wrong interstitials with points, distribution chart, "Ada is on a 3 answer streak" callout, podium. Player and host both reloaded mid-question and landed back in the right phase with the right remaining time; both also restored the podium after reload. Profanity filter rejected `Sh1tLord` in the real join form.

### Notes

- Socket reconnects used to go silently deaf: socket.io reconnects on its own but the server-side room membership is gone, and `tt_join` was only emitted on mount. Found in E2E when a backgrounded host tab stopped receiving events and missed the podium. `useSessionRoom` now re-emits `tt_join` on every `connect` and resyncs from the state API.
- A centered flex column (`justify-center`) clips its own top when the content overflows; the host game view uses `m-auto` on an inner wrapper instead.
- Percentage heights collapse inside an `items-end` flex row (the parent's height is content-derived), which is why the first distribution chart rendered blank.
- frappe-ui's tailwind preset caps `fontSize` at `3xl`; `5xl` and `6xl` joined the existing `4xl`/`8xl` overrides.
- The game loop occupies one `long`-queue worker for the whole game. On this bench a single shared worker serves short/default/long, so an unrelated stuck job stalls every game; deployment wants dedicated long workers.

## Phase 2: Game Engine (2026-07-19)

### Done

- `trivia_tap/engine.py`: RQ game loop (`queue="long"`, `job_id=tt_session_{name}`, `deduplicate`, timeout sized to quiz length). Per question: Redis state write, `question` publish (no correct answer, server `deadline_ts`), sleep-with-poll until deadline + 1s grace, close, score, `question_closed` publish (correct option, distribution, top-5, streak callouts >= 3), then auto-advance after 5s stats or wait for host (capped at 5 min, then advances anyway). After last question: ranks persisted, `podium` published, status Ended, Redis state cleared.
- Redis keys per spec: `tt:{session}:state` (dict, TTL window+30s), `tt:{session}:answered:{question_row}` (set, duplicate pre-check), plus `tt:{session}:control` for host commands (`skip`/`advance`/`end`) polled by the loop. Host controls never touch the loop process directly; the flag survives web/worker process boundary.
- Scoring: Kahoot formula, `response_ms` clamped to window so grace submits floor at 500 base. Streak bonus capped at 250, multiplier 0/1/2. Non-answerers get streak reset at close.
- APIs: host `start_session` (Lobby -> Active, enqueue loop, rejects empty lobby), `next_question`, `skip_question`, `end_session` (Lobby -> Cancelled, Active -> control flag). Guest `submit_answer` (full gauntlet in spec order, returns only `{"ok": true}`, publishes `answer_count`) and `get_state` (reconnect: phase, question sans answer, `remaining_seconds`, own score/answered). Both token-scoped rate-limited.
- Tests: 19 in `tests/test_engine.py`, all green. Whole spec checklist covered: late/duplicate/wrong-question/kicked rejection, DB unique constraint as final word (Redis pre-check bypassed), scoring boundaries + streak reset + multipliers, no `correct` substring in any pre-close payload, reconnect remaining time, full loop to podium with scripted answers.

### Exit criteria verified

Full game played start to podium over HTTP against the live site with the real RQ worker (2 players, 2 questions): questions arrived with correct remaining time, correct answer absent from payloads, duplicate submits got 417, scores/streaks/ranks persisted exactly per formula (checked in DB: 946 + 1982 = 2928, streak 2, rank 1), session Ended with podium event.

### Notes

- Loop commits after each publish so `after_commit` realtime events flush from the worker; submits land in separate web transactions and are visible at close.
- `wait_before_next` accepts host `advance` even during the 5s stats pause; auto-advance mode ignores stray flags.
- Host game-screen state API deliberately deferred to phase 3 (spec lists only guest `get_state`); host reconnect currently rides on the socket events.

## Phase 1: Content + Session Shell (2026-07-19)

### Done

- All five DocTypes per spec: `TT Quiz` (+ child `TT Question`), `TT Session`, `TT Participant`, `TT Answer`. Permissions as specified: Quiz Host `if_owner` on Quiz/Session, System Manager only on Participant/Answer. `TT Answer` gets a DB-level unique index on (participant, question_row) via `on_doctype_update`.
- `trivia_tap/api.py`: host APIs `create_session`, `lock_lobby`, `unlock_lobby`, `kick_participant`, `get_lobby` (host-only via session.host check); guest APIs `join_session`, `leave_session` (`allow_guest`, IP rate-limited 10/min). Tokens: 32-byte random, sha256 stored, raw returned once. Lobby changes publish `lobby_update` (and `kicked`) to room `tt_session_{pin}` with `after_commit=True`.
- Nickname uniqueness (per session, non-kicked) validated in the `TT Participant` controller; kicked nicknames are freed for reuse.
- `trivia_tap/www/trivia_tap.py` boot context injects `csrf_token` + `site_name` so frappe-ui requests work for logged-in hosts.
- Frontend: `Join.vue` (PIN prefilled from `?pin=`, nickname, error display), `Play.vue` (waiting room, live lobby count, kicked banner, leave), `Host.vue` (quiz picker, giant PIN, join link, live participant chips, lock toggle, click-to-kick). Player identity kept in localStorage (`player.js`), thin `api.js` wrapper over `frappeRequest`.
- Tests: 8 integration tests in `trivia_tap/tests/test_api.py`, all green (`bench --site trivia-tap.localhost run-tests --module trivia_tap.tests.test_api`; needed `set-config allow_tests true` once).

### Exit criteria verified

All checked E2E: over HTTP+socket (node client: join publishes `lobby_update` into the room), and in a real headless browser (two tabs, host + player): PIN/QR-link join, name pops on host screen live, wrong PIN 404, locked lobby 417 (error shown in UI), duplicate nickname 409, kick 200 with player seeing "The host removed you" and the kicked token rejected (403).

### Notes

- frappe-ui's tailwind preset caps `fontSize` at `3xl` (24px); display sizes (`4xl`, `8xl`) added in `tailwind.config.js` for the big PIN.
- `frappe.rate_limiter.rate_limit` no-ops when `frappe.request` is absent, so direct calls in tests skip rate limits.
- Deliberate shortcuts: host lobby state is in-memory (page refresh loses the session view; rejoin comes with `get_state` in phase 2); `leave_session` deletes the participant row and only in Lobby status.

## Phase 0: Foundation + Spike (2026-07-19)

### Done

- App `trivia_tap` installed on `trivia-tap.localhost` (module `TriviaTap`).
- Role `Quiz Host` created via fixture (`trivia_tap/fixtures/role.json`, synced on migrate).
- SPA scaffold in `frontend/`: Vue 3 + frappe-ui + Vite, socket.io-client, vue-router with `/join`, `/play`, `/host` stubs. Production build outputs to `trivia_tap/public/frontend` and writes `trivia_tap/www/trivia_tap.html`. Served at `/trivia-tap/*` via `website_route_rules`. Verified: `yarn build` passes, `/trivia-tap/join` returns the SPA, `yarn dev` runs.

### Spike decision: socket push for players. WON.

Question: can a guest (no login) socket.io connection receive events published to a custom room?

Answer: **yes**, verified empirically on this bench (frappe develop, v17):

- Guest sockets authenticate with the `sid=Guest` cookie. `frappe.realtime.get_user_info` returns `installed_apps` from the site (not the user), so app-level socket handlers load for guests too.
- The realtime node server loads `apps/<app>/realtime/handlers.js` per connecting socket. `trivia_tap/realtime/handlers.js` registers `tt_join` / `tt_leave`, which join/leave room `tt_session_{pin}` (PIN validated as 6 digits).
- Test: node socket.io-client connected as Guest, emitted `tt_join 123456`, then `frappe.publish_realtime(event="tt_session_123456", room="tt_session_123456")` from the server. Event received by the guest client.

Consequence: players subscribe over socket.io (`tt_join` after joining a session). No 1s polling fallback is built. `get_state` stays planned for reconnect only.

### Notes

- Bench runs frappe **v17.x-develop**, not stable v16 as plan.md assumes. Spike result applies to this version.
- `bench start` must be restarted after installing a new app: web workers only pick up the editable install at interpreter startup (symptom: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'trivia_tap'` on every request).
- Found and cleared a stale global `maintenance_mode: 1` in `common_site_config.json` that 503'd every site on the bench.
